This directory contains a set of scripts to help you implement your own automated BET translator functions.

It contains the main translator script: BETTranslatorInterface.py that should be imported into your translators.

This BETTranslatorInterface.py script has the functionality to translate 4 different kinds of common propeller
shape information:
1-Xrotor: If you have an Xrotor input file then please look at the examples/xrotorTranslator/sampleXrotorTranslateScript.py script as an example of how to implement your own translator.

2-DFDC:If you have a DFDC input file then please look at the examples/dfdcTranslator/sampleDFDCTranslateScript.py script as an example of how to implement your own translator.

3-C81 polars: IF all you have are 2D section polars of your propeller blades then you can use the examples/c81Translator/sampleC81TranslateScript.py as an example

4-Xfoil Polars: If you have analyzed your 2D foil section using Xfoil and exported the polars using the Xfoil PACC command, we can use those as inputs to the translator. See the examples/xfoilTranslator/sampleXfoilTranslateScript.py

We have also provided a plotBETPOlars.py script that takes the resulting Flow360 input JSON file and plots the BET polars defined inside it. This is very useful to make sure the 2D polars that will be given to Flow360 are as expected.

In the example directories we also have files called:
dfdc_xv15_twist0.case and dfdcTest.case which are sample DFDC input files
xv15_like_twist0.xrotor and ecruzer.prop which are sample Xrotor input files
Xv15_c81_sectionXPolars.csv which are sample Xv15 blade section polars in C81 format
Xv15_xfoil_sectionXPolars.csv which are sample Xv15 blade section polars in xfoil format
flow360_XV15_BET_Template.json is a sample Flow360 input JSON file to which we will add the BET disk information.
